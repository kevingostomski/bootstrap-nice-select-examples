# What is this ?

This is the test project for the [bootstrap-nice-select](https://github.com/kevingostomski/bootstrap-nice-select) component which is setup with `npm link`. Currently, the testing and examples are not pretty automated. If you want to test settings for this component, use Visual Studio Code [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), start the `bootstrap-template4.html` and test stuff with your JavaScript browser console.
